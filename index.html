        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Max Tung, and I'm currently a high schooler with 3+ years of experience programming. I mainly use C# and develop games using the Unity game engine.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <h3><a href="./projects/starfighterlegends.html">Star Fighter Legends</a></h3>
        <p>In this 2D shmup, players control a fighter jet as they blast down enemy fighters using blasters, lasers, and bombs. Collect a variety of powerups and try to obtain the best score that you can. See how far your score places you on the leaderboard and attempt to beat your friends!</p>
        
        <h3><a href="./projects/battleship.html">Battleship Game</a></h3>
        <p>This is a quick console battleship game that includes some historical trivia. Set up your boards and sink your enemy's ships before they sink yours! This project includes a coordinate system with markings for easy navigation.</p>
