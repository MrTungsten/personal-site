        <p>StarFighterLegends is a shmup where the player controls fighter jet as they fight a variety of enemies. Players can destroy their enemies through using a rapid-fire blaster, shooting explosive bombs, blasting high-powered lasers, and even slowing down time! Kill enemies in the quickest time and pick up medals to get the highest score!

        This project originally started due to an idea I had for a Game Design class project. After the project as over I extended the gameplay and added some polish before releasing it on itch.io.
